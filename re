Thank you for reaching out and considering our input for the upcoming monitoring process on GCP.

Regarding counts by state, it might be useful to include metrics such as the number of occurrences,.

I agree the flexibility to change code as per our needs would be crucial
. 
If the RAP API is online soon, I can just modified my previous BQ code then launch the GCP directly 

Once again, thanks for involving us in this process. Looking forward to contributing to the success of this initiative.
