```
# Convert the start_dt to datetime and extract the month
df['month'] = pd.to_datetime(df['start_dt']).dt.month
# Group by month and  srv_cd, then calculate the mean
grouped = df.groupby(['month', 'srv_cd']).billed_amt.mean().reset_index()
# Pivot the table
pivot_table = grouped.pivot(index='month', columns='srv_cd', values='billed_amt')
```
## Multicollinearity

Multicollinearity refers to a situation in which two or more predictor variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated. This means one can be linearly predicted from the others with a high degree of accuracy. When this occurs, it becomes challenging to determine the effect of each predictor variable on the response variable due to the high intercorrelations among the predictors.

### Issues caused by multicollinearity:
1. **Unstable coefficient estimates**: Small changes in the data can result in large changes in the coefficients.
2. **Decreased statistical power**: Leads to wider confidence intervals or larger standard errors.
3. **Interpretation difficulties**: It's hard to determine the effect of each predictor on the response variable.
4. **Overfitting**: Models might fit the training data well but perform poorly on new, unseen data.

### Identifying Multicollinearity:
1. **Correlation Matrix**: Check the pairwise correlations of independent variables. High correlation between any pair indicates possible multicollinearity.
2. **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**: If \( VIF > 10 \), multicollinearity might be high.
3. **Condition Number**: Values above 30 suggest potential multicollinearity.

### Addressing Multicollinearity:
1. **Remove correlated variables**: If multiple variables are highly correlated, consider removing one.
2. **Combine correlated variables**: Use techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to transform correlated variables into uncorrelated ones.
3. **Increase sample size**: Sometimes, more data can help, although it's not always feasible.
4. **Regularization**: Techniques like Ridge and Lasso regression can penalize large coefficients, mitigating multicollinearity effects.
5. **Centering variables**: Subtracting the mean from each data point can help, especially with interaction terms.



# Dealing with Imbalanced Datasets in Classification

Imbalanced datasets can significantly impact the performance of a classification model. Here are some strategies to tackle this issue:

## 1. **Resampling Techniques**
   - **Oversampling**: Increase the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating samples or generating synthetic samples.
     - **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**: Generates synthetic samples in the feature space.
   - **Undersampling**: Reduce the number of instances in the majority class. This method might discard potentially useful data.
     - **Random Under-sampling**: Randomly remove samples from the majority class.
     - **NearMiss**: Select samples from the majority class based on their distances to the minority class samples.

## 2. **Algorithmic Approach**
   - Use algorithms that are naturally equipped to handle imbalances, such as:
     - **Decision Trees**
     - **Random Forests**
     - **Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost)**: Set the `scale_pos_weight` parameter to handle imbalance.
   
## 3. **Cost-sensitive Learning**
   - Introduce different misclassification costs for different classes. Penalize the misclassification of the minority class more than the majority class.
   
## 4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Avoid accuracy as it can be misleading. Opt for metrics that provide a better insight into the minority class performance:
     - **Precision**
     - **Recall**
     - **F1-Score**
     - **Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC)**
     - **Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR)**

## 5. **Ensemble Methods**
   - **Bagging-based**:
     - **Balanced Random Forest**: Combines random undersampling with random forests.
     - **EasyEnsemble**: Uses AdaBoost with random undersampling.
   - **Boosting-based**:
     - **RUSBoost**: Combines random undersampling with boosting.
     - **SMOTEBoost**: Combines SMOTE with boosting.
   
## 6. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Treat the problem as an anomaly detection task rather than a classification problem. The minority class is considered as anomalies.

## 7. **Data Level Techniques**
   - **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that can help in distinguishing between classes.
   - **Cluster-Based Over Sampling**: Create clusters of the majority class and oversample the minority class within each cluster.

## 8. **Use of External Datasets**
   - If available, incorporate external datasets to balance the class distribution.

Remember, it's essential to experiment with multiple strategies and validate the model using a separate test set to find the best approach for a specific dataset.






# Testing the Impact of Coupons on Store Revenue

## 1. **Define the Hypothesis**
Customers who receive a coupon will spend more than customers who don't.

## 2. **Choose Your Metrics**
- **Average transaction amount:** How much, on average, is each customer spending per transaction?
- **Frequency of purchase:** How often do customers come back to purchase?
- **Total revenue:** Total sales from the test group versus the control group.
- **Redemption rate:** The proportion of customers who actually use the coupon.

## 3. **Segment Your Customers**
- **Control group (A):** This group will not receive any coupons.
- **Test group (B):** This group will receive the coupon.

> It's crucial that these groups are randomized and roughly equivalent in terms of purchase history, demographics, etc., to avoid biases.

## 4. **Execute the Test**
Distribute the coupons to the test group (Group B) and observe the behavior of both groups over a specified time frame. This period should be long enough to allow customers ample time to use their coupons but not so long that external factors (like seasonality) skew the results.

## 5. **Analyze the Results**
After the test period, collect and compare the metrics you've decided on for both groups. For instance:
- Did Group B spend more on average than Group A?
- Was there a significant increase in the frequency of purchases in Group B?
- Was the increase in revenue greater than the cost of providing the discount?

## 6. **Statistical Significance**
To ensure that the observed differences between the groups aren't due to random chance, you should conduct a statistical significance test, like a t-test. If the p-value is below a certain threshold (commonly 0.05), then you can conclude that the coupons likely had an effect.

## 7. **Consider External Factors**
Remember to account for external factors that could influence sales, such as:
- **Seasonality:** Are there certain times of the year when sales are naturally higher or lower?
- **Competitor actions:** Did a competitor launch a similar promotion during the test period?
- **Economic factors:** Were there any broader economic changes during the test period that could influence customer spending?

## 8. **Draw Conclusions and Make Decisions**
Based on the results:
- If the coupon had a positive impact on revenue and the increase in revenue was greater than the cost of the discount, consider rolling out the coupon to a broader audience.
- If the coupon did not have a significant impact or led to a loss, reevaluate the coupon's value, terms, and target audience, or consider other promotional strategies.

> Remember that the results of this test apply to this specific coupon and the context in which it was offered. Different coupons or external conditions might produce different results.
