Problem Statement:
In today's data-rich environment, efficiently understanding and utilizing internal database metadata, such as that from an Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW), poses a significant challenge. This complexity is especially daunting for new employees who must quickly familiarize themselves with extensive datasets and tables. The need for a solution that can swiftly interpret queries, elucidate metadata contents, and auto-generate database queries is evident.

Methodology (Simplified & User-Centric):
We propose leveraging the ChatGPT Assistant API to develop a customized AI assistant tailored to our specific data management needs. Our approach is two-fold:

Crafting Smart Prompts: We will develop precise instructions for the AI, guiding it on tasks like analyzing database metadata or generating database queries, akin to providing a detailed job description to a highly skilled assistant.

Seamless Integration: The AI assistant will be integrated directly into our systems through the ChatGPT API, making it readily accessible through our existing tools and platforms.

User Interaction Simplified:
Team members will interact with the AI assistant by typing their database-related questions or requests directly into the system. The AI, using our custom prompts, will instantly return the required information or SQL queries. This functionality will be available across various platforms, ensuring a straightforward and efficient user experience.

Value Proposition:
Enhanced Efficiency: By dramatically reducing the time needed to navigate and understand our databases, we boost productivity, particularly for new hires.
Streamlined Data Management: The AI assistant's ability to auto-generate queries and interpret metadata simplifies data access and management, paving the way for a centralized Data Portal.
