<h2 id="introduction">Introduction:</h2>
<p>With the rapid changes in the housing market over the past decades, understanding and predicting the trajectory of housing prices has become a fundamental task for various stakeholders including policymakers, investors, and individuals. While numerous factors play a role in determining housing prices, census data offers a treasure trove of potential predictors ranging from demographic information to employment metrics.</p>
<h2 id="project-title">Project Title:</h2>
<p><strong>Machine Learning Model to Predict Future Housing Prices Based on a Decade of Census Data</strong></p>
<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement:</h2>
<p>The housing market’s unpredictability poses challenges to potential homeowners, investors, and policymakers. One way to gain insights into future trends is to analyze historical data. The period from 2011 to 2021 experienced numerous socioeconomic and demographic shifts. By leveraging this data, can we predict future housing prices with significant accuracy?</p>
<h2 id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution:</h2>
<p>Develop a robust machine learning model that harnesses a decade’s worth of census data to predict future housing prices. Given the multifaceted nature of the housing market, a combination of regression models, ensemble methods, and possibly deep learning architectures could be employed, depending on the initial findings from exploratory data analysis.</p>
<h2 id="proposed-research-methodologystrategy">Proposed Research Methodology/Strategy:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Collection and Preprocessing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pull the data for specified features using the census API for the years 2011-2021.</li>
<li>Handle missing values, outliers, and potential multicollinearity between independent variables.</li>
<li>Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationship of features with the target variable (Median Home Value).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feature Engineering and Selection:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create new features, if necessary, based on the existing ones to enhance model performance.</li>
<li>Utilize techniques like recursive feature elimination, correlation matrices, and domain knowledge to select the most predictive features.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Model Building:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Split the data into training and testing sets.</li>
<li>Experiment with various machine learning models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, Neural Networks, etc.</li>
<li>Utilize cross-validation to ensure robust performance metrics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Model Evaluation and Optimization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate models based on RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R^2.</li>
<li>Fine-tune model hyperparameters using grid search or random search.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Validation on Recent Data:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Validate the chosen model(s) on the latest year of data (2021) to check its real-world applicability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deployment and Visualization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy the final model via a web interface or API.</li>
<li>Design interactive visualizations to demonstrate potential future trends in housing prices, based on varying input parameters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="datasets-to-be-used">Datasets to be used:</h2>
<p>The primary dataset will be pulled from the Census API with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘states’, ‘fips’, ‘Total Population’, ‘Median Household Income’, ‘Employment Status’, ‘Occupation Distribution’, ‘Median Home Value’, ‘Owner Occupied Units’, ‘Renter Occupied Units’, ‘Age of Housing Stock’, ‘Housing Unit Type’, ‘Vacancy Rate’, ‘Median Rent’, ‘Marital Status’, ‘Households with Children’, ‘Language Spoken at Home’, ‘Foreign-Born Population’, ‘Health Insurance Coverage’, ‘Internet Access’, ‘Vehicle Availability’, ‘Disability Status’, ‘Educational Attainment’, ‘Poverty Status’, ‘Median real estate taxes paid’, ‘Year’.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>The outcome of this research will not only offer a predictive model for housing prices but also uncover key determinants that drive these prices. The insights garnered could potentially guide future policy decisions, real estate investments, and urban planning initiatives.</p>
