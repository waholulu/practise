<h1 id="open-llm">Open LLM</h1>
<p>Open large language models (Open LLMs) refer to a new generation of large language models that are open-sourced and freely available for public use. Some of the most well-known Open LLMs include Meta’s llama-2, Google’s Palm-2.</p>
<p>In contrast to proprietary LLMs like ChatGPT, Open LLMs are designed with transparency and safety in mind. The models and training data are made publicly available for anyone to inspect. The open source nature of these models also allows researchers around the world to contribute to improving them. The goal is to develop increasingly capable and beneficial LLMs guided by the values of transparency, safety and accountability. Unlike closed LLMs, the training and workings of Open LLMs are not shrouded in secrecy.</p>
<p>By making such powerful models openly accessible, Open LLMs aim to democratize AI and spur responsible innovations. Researchers hope these transparent models will set new standards for AI safety and trustworthiness. However, there are still concerns around potential misuse that need to be addressed. Overall, Open LLMs represent an exciting new direction for AI aligned with human values.</p>
