# Convert SHAP values to a DataFrame with feature names as columns
shap_df = pd.DataFrame(shap_values, columns=feature_names)

# You can now work with shap_df as a regular pandas DataFrame
# For example, to get the average impact of each feature:
average_shap = shap_df.mean().sort_values(ascending=False)

# To display or export the average SHAP values
print(average_shap)
# average_shap.to_csv('average_shap_values.csv')
