Proposal for Sage 2.0

Project Name:

Sage 2.0 – Enhanced RAG LLM for Internal Knowledge Management

Background & Introduction

Sage 1.0 was developed as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM chatbot that leverages the company’s internal data and documents to provide intelligent, context-aware responses. While the system has proven to be a valuable tool in assisting employees with quick and accurate information retrieval, there are several areas where improvements can significantly enhance its effectiveness.

With Sage 2.0, we aim to expand the knowledge base, optimize the RAG engine for improved document comprehension, and enhance the front-end user interface to enable better customization and feedback mechanisms.

Objectives

The primary goals of Sage 2.0 include:
	1.	Expanding the Knowledge Base
	•	Incorporate additional internal documents to ensure a more comprehensive coverage of company knowledge.
	•	Improve document ingestion processes for scalability and automation.
	2.	Enhancing the RAG Engine
	•	Optimize document retrieval mechanisms for better accuracy and relevance.
	•	Implement more advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to improve document understanding and answer generation.
	•	Improve ranking algorithms to prioritize the most relevant content for queries.
	3.	Improving User Experience & Interaction
	•	Develop a more interactive front-end interface.
	•	Allow users to provide feedback on chatbot responses to refine accuracy.
	•	Enable users to customize questions and refine their search queries dynamically.

Key Features & Enhancements

1. Knowledge Base Expansion
	•	Automate document ingestion and indexing processes.
	•	Introduce metadata tagging for better document categorization.
	•	Establish a document verification pipeline to ensure data integrity.

2. RAG Engine Optimization
	•	Upgrade retrieval mechanisms with semantic search improvements.
	•	Implement multi-stage filtering to refine relevant document selections.
	•	Enhance response coherence by leveraging contextual understanding models.

3. Front-End User Functionality
	•	User Feedback System – Enable users to rate chatbot responses and suggest corrections.
	•	Customizable Query Options – Provide users with options to refine and adjust their queries for better precision.
	•	Improved UI/UX – Redesign the chatbot interface to improve navigation and usability.

Implementation Plan

Phase	Description	Timeline
Phase 1: Research & Planning	Identify additional documents, analyze current RAG limitations, and define UI/UX improvements.	Month 1-2
Phase 2: Knowledge Base Expansion	Ingest new documents, implement metadata tagging, and improve indexing.	Month 3-4
Phase 3: RAG Engine Enhancements	Optimize retrieval algorithms, improve document comprehension, and test response accuracy.	Month 5-6
Phase 4: Front-End Development	Implement feedback mechanisms, query customization, and UI updates.	Month 6-7
Phase 5: Testing & Deployment	Conduct internal testing, gather feedback, and deploy Sage 2.0.	Month 8-9

Expected Impact
	•	Increased accuracy and relevance in responses.
	•	Greater user engagement through feedback and customization.
	•	More efficient internal knowledge retrieval, reducing time spent searching for information.

Conclusion

Sage 2.0 will build on the foundation of Sage 1.0 by expanding its capabilities, improving document understanding, and enhancing user interaction. This upgrade will provide a smarter, more efficient knowledge management system, ultimately improving productivity and decision-making across the company.

Next Steps
	•	Secure approval for project funding and resource allocation.
	•	Form a dedicated project team and initiate development phases.
	•	Establish KPIs to measure success and impact post-deployment.
