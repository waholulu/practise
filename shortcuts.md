The user asked for a list of the top 30 most useful VSCode GitHub Copilot shortcuts ranked by frequency of use. I know there are several shortcuts like accepting suggestions, showing next/previous suggestions, and generating code, but determining the frequency of use is tricky. Official docs might list the commands, but actual usage data is harder to find. I'd likely have to search for blog posts or reviews that estimate which shortcuts are most commonly used based on developer preferences.

It looks like I need to list common VSCode Copilot shortcuts. From what I found, here are a few:

* Trigger suggestions: Alt + \ (Win/Linux) / Option + \ (macOS)
* See next/previous suggestion: Alt + ] / Alt + \[ (Win/Linux) or Option + ] / Option + \[ (macOS)
* Accept suggestion: Tab
* Dismiss suggestion: Esc
* Open chat/view: Ctrl+Alt+I (Win/Linux), Cmd+I (macOS)

There are more shortcuts for generating and editing code or toggling chat modes, but I don’t have full frequency data yet!

To create a ranked list of the top 30 GitHub Copilot shortcuts, I gathered various suggestions. Here's a sample ranking based mostly on frequency of use:

1. Accept suggestion: Tab
2. Trigger inline suggestion: Alt + \\
3. Next suggestion: Alt + ]
4. Previous suggestion: Alt + \[
5. Dismiss suggestion: Esc
6. Show all suggestions: Ctrl + Enter
7. Open Copilot Chat view: Ctrl + Alt + I
8. Open Quick Chat: Ctrl + Shift + Alt + L
9. Start inline chat: Ctrl + I
10. Toggle chat mode: Ctrl + .

I plan to research further to finalize the table and ensure it's as complete as possible.

I’m trying to pull together a list of some useful GitHub Copilot shortcuts. I’ve found some like accepting suggestions (Tab), toggling inline suggestions (command palette), and opening chat modes. But, I’m still unsure about other shortcuts like undoing suggestions (Ctrl+U?), toggling autocompletion (Ctrl+Shift+?), or showing the full history. I’ve already got about 10 from other sources, but I need 20 more shortcuts to make a solid list. Time to look up more from the extension or cheat sheets!


---

It looks like I’ve come across a few commands related to GitHub Copilot, but I also have some questions. The slash commands like /clear or /help are more for the chat prompt, rather than keyboard shortcuts, which makes me wonder whether to include them. I’ll focus on more traditional keyboard shortcuts for now. There’s also the "next chat suggestion," which might involve using the down arrow key, but I'll need to confirm that. I’ve got some work left to explore here!

I’m exploring GitHub Copilot Chat navigation shortcuts in VSCode, checking various sources like patterns.hattori.dev and code.visualstudio.com.

Some key shortcuts I found include opening the Chat view (Ctrl+Alt+I), starting an inline chat (Ctrl+I), accepting or dismissing suggestions (Tab/Esc), and toggling chat mode (Ctrl+.). However, there’s some overlap with commands and a bit of ambiguity about some shortcuts, like triggering inline suggestions, as patterns.hattori has a different key combo than the official source. I might leave out certain unclear commands for now.

---

I found some keyboard shortcuts and commands related to GitHub Copilot, using various sources. Some distinct shortcuts include accepting or dismissing suggestions, opening chat views, toggling chat mode, and showing the labs feature list. I’m debating whether to add commands like "/explain", "/fix", "/clear", which are triggered in chat, and whether "/fixTestFailure" applies. I’m also considering alternative suggestions like "Rerun inline chat request". It looks like I need more concrete commands to hit the target length.


---

Patterns.hattori provides some useful shortcuts like "Show Labs feature list" (Ctrl + Shift + Alt + E) and "Toggle sidebar" (Ctrl + Shift + A), though the sidebar shortcut lacks further citation. Between multiple sources, I’ve found several commands, but I need more unique ones. For example, trying to include the "GitHub Copilot: Fix" shortcut is tricky because slash commands might not have direct keyboard equivalents. Still searching for ways to include more distinct commands in the list!

---

I’m considering including a shortcut for “Show all suggestions in a quick fix context” via Ctrl + Enter, which is already on the list. There are additional advanced suggestions like opening suggestions in a separate pane (Alt + Enter in JetBrains, Ctrl + Enter in VS Code) that I've added. I also looked into the option of including suggestions for Xcode, but they’re not quite relevant here. It’s tricky to reach 30 unique commands, so I’m working through which examples best fit without repeating.

---

It looks like I’m compiling a list of GitHub Copilot shortcuts that work across both Windows and Mac without duplicates. For example, I’ve got commands for Copilot Edits, like Ctrl + Shift + Alt + I to open the Copilot Edits view, or Ctrl + Alt + B to toggle the sidebar. I’m trying to ensure I’m capturing platforms with commands like the “Accept suggestion” (Tab), and including useful slash commands for chat like "/help" or "/tests." I’m reviewing and refining it to get a good, consolidated list!


---

I'm working on finalizing a list of GitHub Copilot shortcuts, consolidating commands for both general and Copilot Edits use, and ranking them by frequency of use. For instance, common commands like "Accept suggestion" and "Trigger inline suggestion" rank high, while some slash commands like "/explain" and "/fix" are placed accordingly. There are currently 28 commands featuring in total, including the popular ones like "/help" and "/new". I’ll now update the list to reflect these rankings and finalize the order. It’s tricky, but I’m getting there!
